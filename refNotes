populate:

In Mongoose, populate() is used to replace a referenced field in a document with the actual document(s) from the referenced collection. It is commonly used when you have relationships between collections in MongoDB.

How populate() Works

Referenced Field:

If a field in a schema references another collection (using ref), Mongoose allows you to populate that field with the actual data from the referenced collection.

What populate() Does:

It performs an additional query to fetch the referenced document(s) and replaces the reference (e.g., an ObjectId) with the actual data.

await ConnnectionRequest.find({
            $or: [
                { fromUserId: loggedInUser._id },
                { toUserId: loggedInUser._id }
            ]
        }).populate('fromUserId toUserId', 'firstName lastName emailId');

Explanation:

fromUserId and toUserId:

These fields are likely references to the User model (e.g., ref: 'User' in the ConnnectionRequest schema).
populate() replaces the fromUserId and toUserId fields (which are ObjectIds) with the corresponding user documents from the User collection.

Second Argument ('firstName lastName emailId'):

Specifies which fields from the User documents should be included in the result.
Only the firstName, lastName, and emailId fields will be included in the populated data.

Result:

Without populate():

{
  "fromUserId": "6449f8e2b7c3f2a1d8e4b123",
  "toUserId": "6449f8e2b7c3f2a1d8e4b124"
}

{
  "fromUserId": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "emailId": "john.doe@example.com"
  },
  "toUserId": {
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "emailId": "jane.smith@example.com"
  }
}

When to Use populate()

When you need to fetch related data from another collection.

For example:
Fetching user details for a connection request.
Fetching comments for a blog post.

Performance Consideration:

populate() performs additional queries to fetch the referenced data, which can impact performance if overused.
To optimize, avoid populating large datasets or unnecessary fields.
