How express routing works: 

app.use():

The app.use() method is used to register middleware or routers in an Express application.
In this case, it is registering the routers (authRouter, profileRouter, and requestRouter) to handle requests.

Mounting Routers:

Each router (authRouter, profileRouter, requestRouter) is mounted at the root path ("/"). This means that any route defined in these routers will be accessible from the root path of the application.
For example:
If authRouter defines a route like /login, it will be accessible at http://localhost:7777/login.
If profileRouter defines a route like /profile, it will be accessible at http://localhost:7777/profile.

Order of Middleware Execution:

Express processes middleware and routers in the order they are registered. So, requests will first pass through authRouter, then profileRouter, and finally requestRouter.
If a route is matched in authRouter, Express will not proceed to the next router unless next() is explicitly called.

Router Logic:

Each router (authRouter, profileRouter, requestRouter) is likely defined in separate files (e.g., ./routes/auth.js, ./routes/profile.js, ./routes/request.js).
These files export a router object created using express.Router(). For example:

const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

router.post("/login", (req, res) => {
    // Handle login logic
});

module.exports = router;

Routing Flow:

When a request is made to the server (e.g., http://localhost:7777/login), Express will:
Match the root path ("/") and pass the request to authRouter.
If no matching route is found in authRouter, it will proceed to profileRouter.
If still no match, it will proceed to requestRouter.

Separation of Concerns:

By using routers, the application logic is modularized. Each router handles a specific set of routes (e.g., authentication, profile management, requests), making the codebase easier to maintain and scale.
Example Flow:
A POST request to /login:
The request is passed to authRouter.
If authRouter has a /login route, it handles the request and sends a response.
If not, the request moves to profileRouter, and so on.
This modular approach ensures clean and organized routing in the application.
